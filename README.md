> This mod adds the following to the game:
> 
> • Mining Tools (Weapon type)
> • Woodcutting Tools (Weapon type)
> • Construction Tools (Weapon type)
> • Toolbelt (Accessory)
> • Advanced Toolbelt (Accessory)
>
> All can be constructed at the 'Tool Construction Bench' for appropriate costs. The better tools (Drill, Chainsaw, Autohammer) require some plasteel and components to make, but they greatly increase a colonist's speed in the appropriate category.
> The Toolbelt and Advanced Toolbelt are clothing items which improve a colonist's work speeds in each category that the tools affect.
> 
> Everything can also be traded with traders.
