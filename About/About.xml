  <description>This mod adds the following tools to the game:

 • Stone Pick (Tribal Mining)
 • Stone Shovel (Tribal Planting)

 • Pickaxe (Industrial Mining)
 • Axe (Industrial Plantcutting)
 • Hammer (Industrial Construction)

 • Drill (Spacer Mining)
 • Chainsaw (Spacer Plantcutting)
 • Auto-Hammer (Spacer Construction)

 • Toolbelt (Industrial Accessory)
 • Advanced Toolbelt (Spacer Accessory)

Both tribal tools can be constructed at the crafting spot.
All Industrial+ tools can be constructed at the 'Tool Construction Bench' for appropriate costs. The better tools (Drill, Chainsaw, Autohammer) require some plasteel and components to make, but they greatly increase a colonist's speed in the appropriate category.
The Toolbelt and Advanced Toolbelt are clothing items which improve a colonist's work speeds in each category that the tools affect.

Everything can also be traded with traders.
