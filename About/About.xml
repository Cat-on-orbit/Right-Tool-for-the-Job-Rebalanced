  <description>This is a fork of ItchyFlea's "Right Tool For The Job", which is licensed under CC By-SA 4.0.
  	(See this thread: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=6666.0)

This mod adds the following to the game:

 • Mining Tools (Weapon type)
 • Woodcutting Tools (Weapon type)
 • Construction Tools (Weapon type)
 • Toolbelt (Accessory)
 • Advanced Toolbelt (Accessory)

All can be constructed at the 'Tool Construction Bench' for appropriate costs. The better tools (Drill, Chainsaw, Autohammer) require some plasteel and components to make, but they greatly increase a colonist's speed in the appropriate category.
The Toolbelt and Advanced Toolbelt are clothing items which improve a colonist's work speeds in each category that the tools affect.

Everything can also be traded with traders.

Mod Version: 0.17.1.10
